# Mobile Development Environment Setup

## Repository

* **GitHub Repository:** [prodev-mobile-setup](https://github.com/olayenikanmichael-dev/prodev-mobile-setup)
* **Directory:** `mobile-development-setup`

---

## Objective

Mobile development requires more computational resources compared to web development. To streamline the development and testing of mobile applications, we are using the **Expo Framework for React Native**. Expo simplifies mobile app development by providing tools to run and test apps directly on physical devices or emulators.

The purpose of this setup is to ensure a smooth and efficient development workflow for upcoming mobile projects.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js (LTS version)** – Required for running JavaScript on the server and installing dependencies.
   [Download Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/)

2. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** – Recommended IDE for development.
   [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

3. **Operating System** – macOS, Linux, or Windows

4. **Expo Go App** – Allows testing React Native apps directly on a physical device (Android or iOS).
   [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go)

## Why Expo Go?

Mobile development often requires emulators for testing. However, emulators can be resource-intensive and may not reflect real-world device behavior. Expo Go allows you to:

* Test applications directly on your physical device.
* Avoid purchasing multiple devices for testing.
* Seamlessly run projects on both **Android** and **iOS**.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Expo Go**

   * Visit the [Expo Go homepage](https://expo.dev/go).
   * Select the latest SDK version.
   * Click **Install**:

     * **Android:** Install from the Google Play Store.
     * **iOS:** Install from the Apple App Store.

2. **Open Expo Go on Your Device**

   * Launch the app.
   * Create a new account or log in with existing credentials.

3. **Verify Installation**

   * Scan the QR code from your local development environment (once a project is running via Expo CLI) to confirm the app opens successfully on your device.

---

## Documentation of Setup Process

* **Node.js and VS Code** were installed successfully.
* **Expo Go** was installed on [Android/iOS] device.
* Logged in successfully to Expo Go.
* Verified connection by running a sample Expo project (`expo init MyApp`) and scanning the QR code.

**Challenges Faced:**

* [Optional: Mention any issues, e.g., network restrictions, device compatibility, or Expo login problems, and how they were resolved.]

## Next Steps

With Expo Go set up, you can now:

1. Initialize a new React Native project with Expo CLI.
2. Test and iterate applications directly on your physical device.
3. Prepare for upcoming mobile development projects efficiently.
